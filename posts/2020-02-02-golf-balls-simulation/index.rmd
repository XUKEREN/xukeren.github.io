## Problem   

Allan Rossman used to live along a golf course and collected the golf balls that landed in his yard. Most of these golf balls had a number on them. Allan tallied the numbers on the first 500 golf balls that landed in his yard one summer.   

Specifically. he collected the following data:
137  golf balls numbered 1
138  golf balls numbered 2
107  golf balls numbered 3
104  golf balls numbered 4
14 "others" (Either with a different number, or no number at all. We will ignore these other balls for the purposes of this question.)

Question: What is the distribution of these numbers?
In particular, are the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 equally likely?

## My solutions  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
# How many simulations to run?
NumberOfSims <- 10000
NumberofBalls <- 500 - 14

set.seed(123) # set the seed for the random number generator - this makes sure the results are reproducible when we are debugging

# create blank vectors to store values
vec <- vector()
vec2 <- vector()
vec3 <- vector()
vec4 <- vector()
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

  
  
### Simulation

```{r}
# compute maximum frequency for each simlation
for (j in 1:NumberOfSims) {
  for (i in 1:NumberofBalls) {
    vec[i] <- sample(1:4, 1)
  }
  vec2[j] <- max(table(vec))
}

# compute minimum frequency for each simlation
for (j in 1:NumberOfSims) {
  for (i in 1:NumberofBalls) {
    vec[i] <- sample(1:4, 1)
  }
  vec3[j] <- min(table(vec))
}

# compute range of frequency for each simlation
range <- vec2 - vec3

# compute variance of frequency for each simlation
for (j in 1:NumberOfSims) {
  for (i in 1:NumberofBalls) {
    vec[i] <- sample(1:4, 1)
  }
  vec4[j] <- var(table(vec))
}


df <- cbind(vec2, vec3, vec4, range) %>% as.data.frame()

colnames(df) <- c("max", "min", "variance", "range")

dim(df)

head(df)
```


### Minimum frequency  

```{r}
# observed vector
obs <- c(137, 138, 107, 104)

# calculate test statistics
min(obs)

# calculate p-value
a <- df %>%
  filter(min > min(obs)) %>%
  nrow()
pvalue <- 1 - a / NumberOfSims
pvalue

ggplot(aes(x = min), data = df) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = min(obs), size = 1.4, color = "#AFAFFF") +
  annotate("text", x = min(obs) - 5, y = 1000, label = " test statistics = 104 \n pvalue = 0.1481", size = 4)
```


### Variance  

```{r}
# calculate test statistics
var(obs)

# calculate p-value
a <- df %>%
  filter(variance > var(obs)) %>%
  nrow()
pvalue <- a / NumberOfSims
pvalue

# draw the graph
ggplot(aes(x = variance), data = df) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = var(obs), size = 1.4, color = "#AFAFFF") +
  annotate("text", x = var(obs) + 150, y = 600, label = " test statistics = 343 \n pvalue = 0.0336", size = 4)
```


### Range  

```{r}
# calculate test statistics
max(obs) - min(obs)

# calculate p-value
a <- df %>%
  filter(range > max(obs) - min(obs)) %>%
  nrow()
pvalue <- a / NumberOfSims
pvalue

# draw the graph
ggplot(aes(x = range), data = df) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = max(obs) - min(obs), size = 1.4, color = "#AFAFFF") +
  annotate("text", x = max(obs) - min(obs) + 8, y = 600, label = " test statistics = 34 \n pvalue = 0.0742", size = 4)
```



I tried 3 test statistics using simulation-based hypothesis tests.  My null hypothesis here is that the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 distribute equally. My alternative hypothesis here is that the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 do not distribute equally.  

Using minimum frequency of ball number among 486 balls as the test statistics, we simulated 10000 times and made a histogram for these 10000 minimum frequency.  Our observed test statistics = 104 and our pvalue = 0.1481. Thus, with the significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 distribute equally likely.    

Using variance of the frequency of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 as the test statistics, we simulated 10000 times and made a histogram for these 10000 minimum frequency.  Our observed test statistics = 343 and our pvalue = 0.0336. Thus, with the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 do not distribute equally.    

Using range of the frequency of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 as the test statistics, we simulated 10000 times and made a histogram for these 10000 minimum frequency.  Our observed test statistics = 34 and our pvalue = 0.0742 Thus, with the significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 distribute equally.
